  <td> The missing Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH370, had 239 people on board and was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. 
   Malaysia Airlines says the plane lost contact less than an hour after take-off. No distress signal or message was sent.

   But a British aeronautical engineer, who has spent more than a year working on the disaster, thinks he has calculated where MH370 crashed.
   He combined different data sets that were previously kept in separate domains, to align to this new location in the Southern Indian Ocean.

  <td> 
   The vanishing has led to a huge number of theories as to what happened. 
   One of the theories is that it was a 'pilot hijacking', where the pilot took control, and deactivated radar technology before turning around above the Gulf of Thailand and heading west.
   There have been two extensive searches of the Indian Ocean for MH370, which have yielded inconclusive results.
   The searches have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and whilst there is demand from family members to find their loved ones, the costs associated are enormous. 
   We are still not completely solved the the dissapearance of flight MH370, one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.
